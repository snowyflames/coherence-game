The Alignment Protocol. A minimalist puzzle game about synchronization and chaos.
<div align="center">COHERENCEThe Alignment ProtocolOne input. Many outcomes. A minimalist, synchronized puzzle game built with vanilla web technologies.[PLAY IN BROWSER]([INSERT YOUR LINK HERE])</div>📂 OverviewCOHERENCE is a high-contrast puzzle game exploring the concept of entangled movement. The player controls multiple entities across separate, distinct mazes simultaneously.The core mechanic revolves around "The Slide"—entities do not move grid-by-grid but slide until they collide with an obstacle. Due to differing maze layouts, this creates a desynchronization between entities that the player must resolve to align all units on their respective goals simultaneously.✨ Key FeaturesSynchronized Physics: A custom-built movement engine where a single input vector is applied to $N$ distinct game states instantly.100-Level Campaign: Structured progression through 5 sectors ("Genesis" to "Event Horizon"), introducing increasing entropy and grid complexity.Procedural Audio Engine: Features a generative soundtrack using the Web Audio API. A C Minor Pentatonic scale plays over a deep drone, ensuring the audio landscape is never static.Custom Simulation: A sandbox mode allowing users to define parameters (Grid Size, Maze Count) for procedurally generated challenges using a Recursive Backtracker algorithm.Progressive Web App (PWA): Fully manifest-compliant. Installable as a standalone, full-screen application on Android and iOS.🎮 ControlsPlatformInput MethodActionDesktopArrow Keys / WASDSlide DirectionMobileSwipe GesturesSlide DirectionUIMouse / TouchNavigation & Selection🛠️ Technical StackThe project adheres to a "Zero Dependencies" philosophy to ensure maximum performance and portability.Core: HTML5, CSS3 (Grid/Flexbox)Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API (2D Context)Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)Audio: Web Audio API (Oscillators & Gain Nodes)Storage: LocalStorage (Level Progress)🚀 Local DevelopmentTo run this project locally for inspection or testing:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/coherence-game.git](https://github.com/yourusername/coherence-game.git)
